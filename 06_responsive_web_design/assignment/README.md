# Week 3 Assignment - Responsive Web Design

---

### Description


Relaxr's user count has grown, and the number of users accessing the site from a
mobile device has surprised everyone, even by today's standards. The product
managers at Relaxr have asked you to return to the project and make their site
responsive so it renders nicely on mobile devices. They had one of their
internal developers make a few tweaks to your source code, and they have given
you the new HTML / CSS files to work from. Using these starter files, build out
responsive layouts for the landing page and blog.
