var age = parseInt( prompt("Enter a number") );

  * Create an index.html and app.js, and link them
* Write a Javascript program that does the following
  * Ask the user for their age (remember to convert to a number)
  * If they're 21 or over, print the message "Come on in"
  * Otherwise, print the message "You're not old enough" (bonus: Also print how many years later the user should come back. eg. "You're not old enough. Come back in 2 years")
